# MM2T
# The source code of Multi-modal Multi-objective To Two-objective (MM2T)

MM2T was proposed in "Yuto Fujii, Naoki Masuyama, Yusuke Nojima, Naoki Masuyama and Hisao Ishibuchi. A Multi-modal Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm
based on Transformation to Two-objective Optimization Problems. Proceedings of Fuzzy System Symposium (FSS 2020)."

- The codes use PlatEMO published in "Ye Tian et al., PlatEMO: A MATLAB Platform for Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization, IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine, 2017, 12(4): 73-87". 

- Please drop all the codes into the Algorithms folder of PlatEMO (v2.xx).
